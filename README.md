# Magento Frontend – Practice Test (Sagar Doshi)

Convert Figma design to responsive (Mobile and Desktop) Magento frontend. It would be a “plus” if
you can create a custom theme which inherits from Parent theme. Please push completed project
to your Github repository and share the link with us.


**Figma Design:**

**Behaviour, Desktop:**

Images scroll with user down the page. Content on left and right sticks.
When bottom of last image is reached, sticky scroll releases, allowing user to navigate the rest of the
page.

Heart is sticky, resting in the corner the entire scroll of the image block.

**Behaviour, Mobile:**

Users swipe to view more imagery in carousel format.
Indicator below carousel changes to reflect current position in carousel.
